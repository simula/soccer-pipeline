## Abstract

Sports broadcasting is immensely popular, and the interest in consuming various forms of multimedia from soccer games grows day by day. The availability of content and the large number of games make systems for extracting highlights and providing summaries in real- or near real-time increasingly important. For instance, the generation of highlight clips and video summaries from soccer games is of tremendous interest for broadcasters, as a large percent of audiences prefer to view only the main events in a game. However, annotating events and producing summaries often require expensive equipment and cumbersome manual labor. Automatic soccer multimedia production pipelines have therefore gained attention in recent years. In this context, developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology have shown great potential. 

In this tutorial, we describe the fundamentals of an automatic end-to-end soccer multimedia production pipeline. We provide an overview and taxonomy of the individual tasks in the pipeline, along with relevant concepts, methods, and technologies. Focusing on 4 tasks, namely event detection and classification, event clipping, thumbnail selection, and game summarization, we reflect on the state-of-the-art solutions, and describe our own work using multimodal data analysis and neural networks for improved performance. We elaborate on our results which are both quantitative (comprising performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, latency, and complexity) and qualitative (insights from subjective user studies and industry feedback). We also disseminate our experiences from building a commercial tagging operation center (currently used in the Swedish elite leagues [*Allsvenskan*](https://www.allsvenskan.se/) and [*Superettan*](https://www.superettan.se/), and to be introduced in the Norwegian [*Eliteserien*](https://www.eliteserien.no/)), as well as organizing the research competition [MMSys’22 Grand Challenge on AI-Based Video Production for Soccer](https://mmsys2022.ie/authors/grand-challenge). 

Upon completion of the tutorial, attendees will have a deeper understanding of automatic soccer multimedia production, including the state-of-the-art research and industry solutions, as well as open challenges and next steps.
